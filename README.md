# Vehicle-Traffic-Counter-using-YOLO-and-SORT
Detect and count all vehicles crossing preset coordinate lines and YOLO, SORT as base algorithms.
<br>
YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect objects on each of the video frames. SORT to track those objects over different frames.
<br>
YOLO v3 is used as the primary algorithm and used a dataset of around 23000 images. Further, used a coordinate line as reference to count vehicles.

# Usage
Run main.py using `python3 main.py`
