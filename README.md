# Vehicle-Traffic-Counter-using-YOLO-and-SORT
Detect and count all vehicles crossing preset coordinate lines and YOLO, SORT as base algorithms.
<br>
YOLO to detect objects on each of the video frames. SORT to track those objects over different frames.
<br>
I used YOLO v3 as the primary algorithm and used a dataset of around 23000 images. Further, used a coordinate line as reference to count vehicles.
